                                <h3>Temilore</h3>
                                <p>How we met was rather magical, I’d say - like a meet-cute straight out of a TV screen; entirely scripted, with the right pauses, the right plays...all we had to do was show up.</p>
                                <p>Stage set...action. Our love story began at my cousin’s wedding on 26/12/2015. I was a bridesmaid but I was meeting my cousin’s husband for the first time, so I went over to say hi and congratulations to him. He was with his friends, and I knew that I felt someone’s gaze on me. I stayed focused, said what I wanted to say and returned to my family.</p>
                                <p>I love a good movie meet-cute when eyes finally lock and time stops...so imagine my surprise when I was having unprovoked eye contact with this very handsome stranger who looked like he knew me from somewhere. After all the looking (STARING) at each other, looking for each other, waving happily across a corridor without knowing each other’s names, him averting his gaze from me during his toast so he won’t stumble over his words, we finally met and said each other’s names. What a moment!</p>
                                <p>Tomiwa (literally) walked very briskly into my life that day to get my number as I was leaving (desperado :P)...and here we are, almost five years later! I’m marrying the most amazing person I’ve ever known, my friend, my Life’s Great Love, the face I’d always look for in a crowded place. I’m at my best with you, Toms, and I can’t wait to live out the rest of my days with you.</p>

                            <div className="story">
                                <p>We met at my friend’s wedding in 2015.</p>
                                <p>We were both on the train. I was jejely minding my business and discharging my duties as Ore Oko. Having prostrated etc, I took my seat in the row behind the groom. The arrangement of the event was such that the bride’s squad and family sat opposite the groom squad and family. The main event unfolded in the space between.</p>
                                <p>And lo, I looked up. </p>
                                <p>I saw her. Our eyes met briefly. And everybody just faced their front to keep minding their business. And I would catch myself looking or wanting to look. Then, we would sort of catch each other staring. Hmmm (Trouble!). So, as a sharp guy, I started unlooking, but in a way that she’d still be in my field of view. Eventually, the engagement event wrapped up and we all left to eat and change for the joining. There was an eatery in the building, so most people just went to chill there while waiting for proceedings. I went in there and I must have scanned through the crowd a thousand times, looking for her. (Which kain thing be dis?). I just tried to get it out of my mind, dismissing the whole thing as a wedding bug. (Meeting love interests at weddings was just too cliche for contrarian me.)</p>
                                <p>I couldn’t join the groom’s train.</p>
                                <p>The tailor contracted decided taking my measurement was not necessary. So he just showed up that day with my suit, like a boss. Of course, you know how that story ends. LOL. After literally seeing my James Bond dreams go up in flames, I ate my humble pie and stayed inside my White Agbada. I guess it was God’s plan. That Agbada was lit. Still lit. But I digress.</p>
                                <p>I joined the proceedings a bit later.</p>
                                <p>But I couldn’t sit with the squad. So I sat with my friend at the back of the hall and as usual, we started pontificating and contemplating the meaning of life. Who am I even kidding? I was telling him about my encounter and how this stranger is now squarely lodged in my imagination. As you would expect, I already mapped where she was seated and resumed my unlooking. Haha</p>
                                <p>She became my business. </p>
                                <p>(I thought I came for my friend’s wedding?) Well, na so we see am. Now, I’m tracking her every move everywhere she went with my spidey senses, all the while trying to keep my calm. Until she came by my side to use the restroom. I smiled and waved. She smiled back and waved. It felt like we’ve been friends for a long time. (Lights. Camera. Butterflies!)</p>
                                <p>It was time for me to give the toast. </p>
                                <p>I had been a close observer in my friend’s love story, so this was naturally my home turf. The MC called my name to come forward. Everyone (including her) kept looking around for this person and then I emerged walking down the long aisle all the way from the back, in my flowing white Agbada (think slo-mo scenes of Astronauts going to mount the ship). I could imagine the surprise. So I tried not to look at her side this time, because in my mind, I really had an audience of one. I think I nailed the speech, except that I had to find a glass of drink to raise the toast. Alas, her table was the closest, so I went there to get one. It was at that moment that I knew, I had nerves of steel. I was careful not to look down, though I knew she was right there LOOKING AT ME! For if I had looked, son of man would have gone blank with his speech, and that would have been the end of cinema. </p>
                                <p>But I survived. </p>
                                <p>Got a round of applause even. And I made my way back, feeling like I won Olympic Gold. (What’s doing me sef? I am definitely overthinking this thing). I went back to my seat and chopped knuckle with my guy. He said I finished work. I believed him. And the game of hide and seek started o. (hmm!). This babe went to sit with her whole family at the reception! Father, Mother, Older brother (you know how they can be, LOL, but Moyo is the coolest haha), Older sister (oh my guardian angel, as you would soon see). Even if I wanted to shoot shot, hoooow? There was just no chance again. At this point, I had no other business again but her. I was busy doing scenario planning with my guy. Serious strategy session o. (Ah, I suffered).</p>
                                <p>Then it was time to go.</p>
                                <p>God no go shame us. The entire family stood up to leave. This babe, this babe was right in front of the procession. I said e gba mi! Omo yi ma ti n lo ke! At that point, all hope seemed to fade out to silence. Just silence. I was dejected. And then, like a dream, she slowed down, and her family members started walking past her and leaving the hall. (Wait, what?). In what seemed like forever (but really, it must have been milliseconds), I sprang up and literally sprinted towards her. Our paths intersected right at the exit doorway. And that’s how we stood facing each other. The end.</p>
                                <p>And the award for the lamest opening line goes to……… (drumrolls)...... me.</p>
                                <p>Are you married? Like, yo, really? Who even says that to somebody? (Well, you are looking right at him). She laughs and says not at all. At this point, I was sure if she had paid just a bit more attention to my mouth, she would see my heart gyrating inside. I laugh when guys talk about game. Because really, except the Lord builds the house…. Hahaha</p>
                                <p>I managed to ask for her number. </p>
                                <p>My phone was dead, I didn’t have a pen, no paper. (Gosh I’m a dork). Like my suit tailor, I decided my brain was at its best and could memorise her number. So I asked for it anyway and she called it out. 0-7-0-5-6-5-5-7-5-0-4. Me: 0-7-0-w-5-3-#-7-3.-7-# So she asked me to recite it. Of course I said rubbish. She laughed at me and said I would end up calling an old lady! That was when it all came to me, in one flash of inspiration, to get a pen and paper. (Rolls my eyes). Eventually, I scribbled her number at the back of an envelope, and said goodbye. I turned back almost immediately. Stunned, flustered, flabbergasted, gbogbo e. But mehn, walking back to my seat, I felt triumphant, like a king who had won great spoil. </p>
                                <p>Return of the king.</p>
                                <p>I collapsed in my seat. My head was hot. I said to my guy, “”Let’s go home”. At that moment, I realised she was why I came to the wedding. She was my business that I should have been minding all along. And so, we also got up, and left.</p>
                                <p>About my guardian angel.</p>
                                <p>Remember? Yea, it turned out that she was the one who told her to drop backwards so I could have a chance to talk to her. If she had not done this singular thing, my dears, maybe, I’d be writing about that old lady! God forbid. </p>
                                <p><strong>#TTLaiLai</strong></p>
                                <p>And that’s how that moment turned into years, and how the years will turn into forever. With life’s greatest love.</p>
                                <p>Thanks for coming to my TED talk.</p>
